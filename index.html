	<p>I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.
		I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with Professor Sergey Levine 
		at the Robotic AI & Learning Lab, Professor Alice Agogino at the Berkeley
		Emergent Space Tensegrities Lab, and with Professor Wenzhen Yuan at the
		RoboTouch Lab at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
