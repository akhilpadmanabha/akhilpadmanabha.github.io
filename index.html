	<p>I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. During my undergraduate years,
	I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with Professor Sergey Levine at the
	<a href="http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/" style="color:rgb(0,102,204);">Robotic AI & Learning Lab</a>,
	Professor Alice Agogino at the
	<a href="https://best.berkeley.edu/" style="color:rgb(0,102,204);">Berkeley Emergent Space Tensegrities Lab</a>,
	and with Professor Wenzhen Yuan at the
	<a href="https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/robotouch" style="color:rgb(0,102,204);">RoboTouch Lab</a>
	at Carnegie Mellon University. In addition to research, I had the amazing opportunity
	to intern at SpaceX in Boca Chica, Texas where I led a project to deploy robot dogs for Starship launch operations.
	I additionally interned for funded robotics startup,
	<a href="https://www.viabot.com/" style="color:rgb(0,102,204);">ViaBot</a>, where I did rapid prototyping and mechatronics design for
  <a href="https://www.viabot.com/gallery" style="color:rgb(0,102,204);">RUNO 1.3</a>. Lastly, I
	led the
	<a href="https://robobears.berkeley.edu/" style="color:rgb(0,102,204);">RoboBears</a>
  combat robotics team at UC Berkeley, where I started the annual collegiate Cal Combat Robotics Competition.
